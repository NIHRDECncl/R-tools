2:Assessing the clinical utility of a diagnostic test&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Graph 2 illustrates how decisions are made with information
from a diagnostic test. The clinical utility of the test is the net
benefit to patients, and is determined by the outcomes which follow
from the management decisions made on the basis of the test's results.
Thus, the first step to assessing clinical utility is to understand the
factors that determine decision-making. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
The graph on the Decisions tab is dynamic: it allows you to study a
specific&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">condition,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">test</span> to
diagnose the condition, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">clinical
decisions</span> that can be made on the basis of the test
result:.<br>
<p>The graph allows you to explore&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>the probability of a disease or condition before a
diagnostic test (i.e. the prevalance of the condition), and<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>the
probabilities after postive and negative test results
(i.e.&nbsp;the post test
probabilities: PPV (postive predictive value) and NPV (negative
predictive value)). <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The thresholds which post test probabilities must pass for
a test result to support a clinical decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
graph shows a lot of information. But, if you want to understand the
value and and appropriate use of diganostic tests, it is worth
investing some effort learning to read the graph. Each element of the
graph is explained below with reference to the (static) scree snip in
the figure below.</p>

<p>You may have noticied that there are not one, but two Y-axes!</p>
<ul>
<li>The left-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible pre-test
probabilities: from 0 to 1 (scale shown)<br>
.</li>
<li>The right-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible post-test
probabilities: also from 0 to 1 (scale not shown).</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The X-axis</h3>
<p>Did you notice that there is no X-axis!</p>
<p>(This is why there is no scale and no line number keyed for
the X-axis)</p>
<p>Although
the graph might seem to be a normal X-Y plot, what looks like an X-axis
is a visual metaphor showing how test results move from pre-test
probability on&nbsp;the left to post-test probability on the
right.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The decision threshold
for a positive test<small><small> (line 3)<br>
and </small></small><br>
The post-test probability for a positive test (PPV) <small><small>(line
7)</small></small></h3>
If a test is positive, the result may be used to
justify&nbsp;clinical decisions, such as "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">rule in</span>
the disease and manage accordingly".<br>
Note
that a positive result may only be used to justify a rule in decision
if the post-positive test probability is above the rule in decision
threshold.<br>
<p>You can change the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">specificity</span>
and prevalence settings on the left to see how this changes the
post-positive test probability (i.e. positive predictive value, PPV),
and check if it exceeds the decision
threshhold. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">sensitivty</span>
settings on the left and check that this does not changes the
post-positive test probability.</p>
<p>Change
the population size and see how the precision (95% confidence interval)
changes ---
this is shown as the salmon pink ribbon around the post-positive test
line.<br>
If the confidence interval includes the decision threshold,
you should <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>be confident in
using the result to justify a rule in
decision. </p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The decision threshold
for a negative test<small><small> (line 4)<br>
and </small></small><br>
The post-test probability for a negative test (NPV) <small><small>(line
6)</small></small></h3>
Similarly, if a test is negative, the result may be used to
justify&nbsp;clinical
decisions, such as "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">rule out</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>the disease and
manage accordingly".<br>
Note
that a negative result may only be used to justify a rule out decision
if the post-negative test probability&nbsp;(i.e. negative
predictive value, NPV) is below the rule out decision threshold.<br>
<p>You can change the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">sensitivity</span>
setting on the left to see how this changes the
post-negative test probability, and check if it falls below the
decision
threshhold. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">specificity </span>settings
on the left and check that this does not changes the
post-negative test probability.</p>
<p>Change
the population size and see how the precision (95% confidence interval)
changes ---
this is shown as the sea green ribbon around the post-negative test
line.<br>
If the confidence interval includes the decision threshold,
you should <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span>
be confident in using the result to justify a rule out
decision.</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The pre-test
probability (prevalence) <small><small>(line 5)</small></small></h2>
The pre-test probability of the condition, its prevalence, is shown by
the horizontal green line (numbered 5).<br>
<p>You can change the&nbsp;prevalence setting on the left to
see how this changes the
post test probabilities. See at what levels the prevalence must be for
the post test probabilities to just fail to cross the decision
thresholds. The significance of this is that, if the&nbsp;post test
probability with a positive result is less than the decision threshold,
there is no point in doing the test to make the diagnosis. Similarly,
if the&nbsp;post test probability with a negative result is greater
than the decision threshold, there is no point
in doing the test to rule the diagnosis out.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Where do I find the
data?</h2>
<p>Data for your condition's prevalence and the test's accuracy
(sensitivity and specificity) will be in the scientific literature,
unless the test is under development, in which case unpublished data
from the developer may be available.Use data from a (well conducted and
well reported) systematic review and meta-analysis, if this is
available. Otherwise, use data from a&nbsp;(well conducted and well
reported) study. Data for the population size should be available from
the the source of your accuracy data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obtaining reliable data for the decision thresholds can be a
challenge. But it is a challenge worth rising to, as the decision
thresholds&nbsp;determine the clinical utility of the test.</p>
<p>Health economists do the kind of studies that determine
the&nbsp;decision threshold that provide the optimum cost for net
benefit --- net benefit takes account of&nbsp;benefits and the
harms. Costs, benefits, and harms are those that follow from doing the
test and acting on its result.</p>
<p>In technical terms, the recipe that the health economists
folllow is:</p>
<div class="" style="margin-left: 40px;">Decision
threshold = (net harm)/(net harm + net benefit)<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.6364px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18.1818px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline ! important; float: none;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><br>

<p>Because this type of health economic study is difficult and
expensive, clinicians often have to use intuition and gut feeling to
decide on decision thresholds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal setting of decision thresholds can be biased, either
by over-emphasising the benefits in comparison with the harms, or vice
versa.&nbsp; </p>
