    Around 2400 years ago a Greek physician called Hippocrates wrote a
    book on <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hp.%20Prog.">Prognosis</a>.
    At that time doctors had few effective treatments to offer their
    patients, so providing them with accurate information on their
    prognosis was (thought to be) useful. <br>
    <br>
    Hippocrates' book sold well, and he has been famous ever since.<br>
    <br>
    These days we have many effective medical and surgical treatments.
    But, there are many more conditions than cures. So the question,
    "What is the prognosis?" is still feared, avoided, and often
    answered misleadingly. <br>
    <br>
    This app is intended to help people for whom prognosis is an issue,
    certainly doctors, and possibly patients who want to know what their
    likely outcome is.<br>
    <br>
    Prognosis is difficult to understand, and when a single number is
    given for chance of survival, it will be misleading: doctors
    understand this intuitively, and studies have confirmed this
    empirically --- as a rough rule of thumb, least 50% of people given
    a prognosis and duration to outcome, will exterience the outcome
    very much earlier or very much later than they were advised
    (Henderson 2009).<br>
    <br>
    So this app aims to help people:<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Ask</b> their doctors the "right" questions about prognosis</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Understand</b>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Why a single number is misleading --- <b><font
              color="#993300">never ever take at face value statements
              such as "your prognosis is x% over n weeks/months/years"</font></b></li>
        <li>That a prognosis changes with new information, such as the
          fact that you have survived <b>n</b> weeks/months/years</li>
        <li>That a prognosis is uncertain and you need to know what the
          changes are for:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>the best outcome you can hope for<br>
          </li>
          <li>the worst outcome you might consider planning for<br>
          </li>
          <li>the average outcome in a group of people similar to you,
            and how precisie the estimate is<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    Getting a prognosis can be unpleasant, and is often not needed. So,
    if you are worried about what you might find here, close the app
    now. <br>
    <br>
    Those who are still curious, should begin with the next tab.<br>
