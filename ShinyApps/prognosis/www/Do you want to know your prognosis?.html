    Getting a prognosis can be distressing, and is often neither wanted
    nor needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    So, if you are worried about what you might find here, and don't
    need to know about your (or a loved one's) prognosis, close the app
    --- but, before you go, please remember that if you are ever given a
    number, there is so much uncertainty around it (i.e. the time frame
    is so wide) that any single number has a 50% chance of being wildly
    wrong (as proved by Annie). <br>
    <br>
    However, many people do want to understand what a prognosis means,
    patients should know how to ask their doctors the "right" questions
    about prognosis, and doctors and other health care professionals <i><b>need</b></i>
    to be able to interpret the numbers for their patients and patients'
    families.<br>
    <br>
    If you are comfortable with graphs, you can use this app to find
    out:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>What a prognosis is, and why it is not just "news you don't
        want to get"<br>
      </li>
      <li>Why <b>a single number is misleading</b> --- <b><font
            color="#993300">never ever take at face value statements
            such as "your prognosis is x% over n weeks/months/years"</font></b></li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>That a <b>prognosis changes</b> with new information --- the
        most obvious example of such new information would be the fact
        that you have survived for so many weeks/months/years</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>That a <b>prognosis is very uncertain</b> --- so you need to
        know what the chances are for:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>the <b>best</b> outcome you can hope for<br>
        </li>
        <li>the <b>worst</b> outcome you might consider planning for<br>
        </li>
        <li>the <b>average</b> outcome in a group of people similar to
          you, and how precise the estimate is</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are not comfortable with graphs, you could give the app a
      try and see if it works for you. Or, you could wait a while until
      we have wordy explanations to go with the graphs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the condition you are interested in is not in here, you might
      want to see what the general principles are for understanding any
      prognosis.<br>
