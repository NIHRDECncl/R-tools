        notes on conditional survival and prediction intervals</font></h1>
    <p>This is not a detailed explantion of the methods used for
      estimating and displaying conditional survival and prediction
      intervals, but a brief pointer to sources that informed the
      development of this app.<br>
      The sources are referenced, and linked.<br>

    <h2><font color="#333399">Conditional survival</font><br>
    </h2>
    <p>Conditional survival is one of those ideas that seem to need to
      be re-discovered repeatedly. A Pubmed search found only 80
      articles with "conditional survival" in the title and "prognosis"
      in the title or abstract. The earliest being in 1995.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even the most recently published paper using the methodology
      finds it necessary to explain that:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      Some aspects of&nbsp;prognosis&nbsp;are not reflected by
      cumulative survival estimates. These aspects include information
      on the time already survived by the patient and the patient's
      survival compared with the general population.&nbsp;Conditional
      survival&nbsp;(ie, conditional on having survived a certain period
      of time already) and relative&nbsp;conditional survival&nbsp;(ie,
      compared with the general population) do incorporate these
      aspects. (Baart et al, 2017)<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

    <p>The underlying statistics and graphical presentations of
      conditional survival data are covered in some detail by (Hieke et
      al, 2015) in an open access article.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><font color="#333399">Prediction interval</font><br>
    </h2>
    <p>The fact that prediction for an individual is not the same as
      prediction for a group, and requires a different measure of
      uncertainty is even less well known than conditional survival. It
      is telling that one of the earliest publications on the
      uncertainties inherent in prediction for individuals was published
      (open access) in the Journal of Medical Ethics (Henderson and
      Keiding, 2005). The authors explain why "models and statistical
      indices can be useful at the group or population level, but that
      human survival is so uncertain that even the best statistical
      analysis cannot provide single-number predictions of real use for
      individual patients". <br>
    </p>
    <p>It is also telling that the concept does not (yet) have a widely
      used name, at least amongst clinicians. <br>
    </p>
    <p>We use "prediction interval" to mean an interval describing the
      uncertainty around a prediction for an individual.<br>
      The interval is derived from the distribution of individual
      outcomes, and Henderson and Keiding suggest that the 10th to 90th
      centiles might be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A prediction interval is analogous to the confidence cnterval (or
      credible interval) for a group.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A way of visualizing the distributions from which prediction
      intervals can be derived is suggested by (Royston, Parmar, and
      Altman, 2008). <br>
    </p>
    <p>The challenges of visualizing time-to-event data are further
      discussed by (Witte, 2008).<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the To Do list for a future version of this app is to include
      in the margins of the prognosis plots the distributions from which
      prediction intervals are derived. <br>
      There will also be an option to choose the width of the prediction
      interval. For example, from the 10th to 90th centile to the 5th to
      95th centile.<br>
