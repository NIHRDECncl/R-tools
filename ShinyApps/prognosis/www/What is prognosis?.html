    <h3><font color="#333399">Technical explanations</font></h3>
    <p>(This bit is only slightly technical, so don't go away before you
      have read the explanation of why the usual way of giving a
      prognosis is wrong. The real technical bits are in the statistics
      section.)<br>
    </p>
    <font color="#333399"><b>Prognosis = Prediction</b></font><br>
    A prognosis is a prediction about an outcome such as survival, or
    disease-free survival.<br>
    <b><br>
    </b><b><font color="#333399">Group or Individual</font><br>
    </b>A prognosis can be for a group. Or, it can be for an individual.<br>
    <br>
    The distinction is important because predictions about individuals
    are much more uncertain than those about groups.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#333399"><b>Any prognosis is uncertain</b></font><br>
    Because any prediction is uncertain, a prognosis that is given to
    you as a single number (like the examples above), is very likely to
    be way out. Misleading. Wrong.<br>
    <br>
    And that means that any prognosis should be up front about how
    uncertain it is.<br>
    <br>
    Before explaining how uncertainty in prognosis should be explained,
    the fact that an uncertain prognosis is useful needs to be
    explained.<br>
    <font color="#333399"><br>
      <b>Uncertainty in prognosis is useful</b></font><br>
    Uncertainty in prognosis is useful because it enables you to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Hope for the best (which is not usually provided)</li>
      <li>Plan for the worst</li>
      <li>Bet on the most likely (i.e. average)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also enable you to see why you should <b>not</b>:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plan or bet on the worst outcome</li>
      <li>Plan or bet on the best outcome</li>
      <li>Hope for the average outcome <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because this is a good strategy to follow whether or not you have
      a prognosis to worry about, it is a good reason not to ask about
      your prognosis!<br>
    </p>
    <font color="#333399"><b>Uncertainty = Prediction Interval</b></font><br>
    A prognosis should, as a minimum, have two numbers that predict:<br>
    <blockquote><b>For an individual</b>: the best and worst that can be
      expected<br>
      <b>For a group</b>: the range including the most likely outcome <br>
    </blockquote>
    <font color="#333399"><b>Prognosis changes</b></font><b><br>
    </b>A prognosis is not a constant. <br>
    It changes as new information becomes available. <br>
    So, the prognosis you were given yesterday is a less accurate today,
    because you know you have lived another day, and this fact changes
    the predition.<br>
    Technically this is called "conditional survival". <br>
    <br>
    Conditional survival is a short way of explaining what your
    prognosis is, given the condition that you have survived 1, 2, ...
    years (or whatever unit of time is appropriate).<br>
    <br>
    The idea of conditional survival is important for two reasons:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You aren't stuck with the prognosis you were originally given.
        It changes. It can change for the worse. But, it can also change
        for the better.</li>
      <li>As the graphs available on the Facts tab show, your prognosis
        tends to get better over time, especially for those with the
        worst initial prognosis</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3><font color="#000066"><font color="#333399">Hope and fear</font><br>
      </font></h3>
    <p>A prognosis is usually frightening, because it means "things that
      were&nbsp; never in your plan", as one patient said.<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, hope is always possible. And, because a prognosis is
      uncertain and it changes, a better outcome than you fear is always
      possible. <br>

    <br>
    Around 2400 years ago a Greek physician called Hippocrates wrote a
    book on <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hp.%20Prog.">Prognosis</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    At that time doctors had few effective treatments to offer their
    patients, so providing them with information on their prognosis was
    thought to be useful --- for the patient and the physician. <br>
    <br>
    Hippocrates' main aim in writing his book was to provide doctors
    with advice on what in today's management jargon is called
    reputation management.<br>
    <br>
    It appeared to Hippocrates to be an excellent thing for doctors to
    err on the side of caution. <br>
    In other words, to prefer giving a bad prognosis: if the patient
    survives they and their family will not mind nearly so much as if
    they were given a good prognosis which turns out to be wrong.<br>
    <br>
    Hippocrates' book sold well, and he has been famous ever since,
    especially for the aspiration to "cure sometimes, to treat often,
    and to comfort always".<br>
    <br>
    Today's doctors hopefully will want to give their patients an
    accurate prognosis, and won't be so concerned about the unseemly
    side of reputation management. But the information and concepts
    needed to do this have been lacking. <br>
    <br>
    This app aims to fill this gap for patients, their families, and
    healthcare professionals.<br>
