2:Assessing the clinical utility of a diagnostic test&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Graph 2 shows how decisions are made with information
from a diagnostic test. The clinical utility of the test is the net
benefit to patients, and is determined by the outcomes which follow
from the management decisions made on the basis of the test's results.
Thus, the first step to assessing clinical utility is to understand the
factors that determine decision-making. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>You may have noticied that there are not one, but two Y-axes!</p>
<ul>
<li>The left-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible pre-test
probabilities: from 0 to 1 (scale shown)<br>

<li>The right-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible post-test
probabilities: also from 0 to 1 (scale not shown).</li>

<p>Did you notice that there is no X-axis!</p>
<p>(This is why there is no scale and no line number keyed for
the X-axis)</p>
<p>Although
the graph might seem to be a normal X-Y plot, what looks like an X-axis
is a visual metaphor showing how test results move from pre-test
probability on&nbsp;the left to post-test probability on the
right.</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Where do I find the
data?</h2>
<p>Data for your condition's prevalence and the test's accuracy
(sensitivity and specificity) will be in the scientific literature,
unless the test is under development, in which case unpublished data
from the developer may be available.Use data from a (well conducted and
well reported) systematic review and meta-analysis, if this is
available. Otherwise, use data from a&nbsp;(well conducted and well
reported) study. Data for the population size should be available from
the the source of your accuracy data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obtaining reliable data for the decision thresholds can be a
challenge. But it is a challenge worth rising to, as the decision
thresholds&nbsp;determine the clinical utility of the test.</p>
<p>Health economists do the kind of studies that determine
the&nbsp;decision threshold that provide the optimum cost for net
benefit --- net benefit takes account of&nbsp;benefits and the
harms. Costs, benefits, and harms are those that follow from doing the
test and acting on its result.</p>
<p>In technical terms, the recipe that the health economists
folllow is:</p>
<div class="" style="margin-left: 40px;">Decision
threshold = (net harm)/(net harm + net benefit)<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.6364px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18.1818px; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: inline ! important; float: none;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><br>

<p>Because this type of health economic study is difficult and
expensive, clinicians often have to use intuition and gut feeling to
decide on decision thresholds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal setting of decision thresholds can be biased, either
by over-emphasising the benefits in comparison with the harms, or vice
versa.&nbsp; </p>
