    <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">How to read graph 2: clinical
      utility of a diagnostic test</h2>
    <p>Graph 2 illustrates how decisions can be made rationally using
      information from a diagnostic test.</p>
    <p> A rational decision is one based on the clinical utility (i.e.
      the net benefits, harms, and costs) expected to follow from that
      decision.</p>
    <p>The clinical utility of a positive test result depends on (i) the
      net benefit for people who have a true positive result, and (ii)
      on the net benefit for people who have a false positive result.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the clinical utility of a negative test result depends
      on (i) the net benefit for people who have a true negative result,
      and (ii) on the net benefit for people who have a false negative
      result.</p>
    So, on balance for a group of people, their average clinical utility
    for a positive result depends on the true and false postive rates of
    the test, and for a negative result on true and false negative rates
    of the test.
    <p>Thus, the first step to assessing clinical utility is to
      understand the factors that determine decision-making. This is
      quite tricky, but Graph 2 can help. The aim is to gain an
      intuitive understanding of the predictive values of a test (the
      probabilities of the condition being present when a test is
      positive, or being absent when the test is negative), how these
      depend on the prevalance (prior probability) of the condition, and
      how treatment decisions depend, not simply on the result, but on
      the rates of true and false results.</p>
    <p>The explantions below require careful reading and exploration of
      the interactive graph, but this will be be repaid by the solid
      understanding that will result.<br>

    <p>The figure below is a screen snip showing how graph 2 looks when
      the app is started.<br>
      When you customise the labels and data, it will (obviously) look
      somewhat different.<br>
      In particular, if you do not see the pink and green ribbons, reset
      the population size (n) to 300.<br>

    <p>You may have noticied that there are not one, but two Y-axes!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The left-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible pre-test
        probabilities: from 0 to 1 (scale shown)<br>
        .</li>
      <li>The right-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible post-test
        probabilities: also from 0 to 1 (scale not shown).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The X-axis</h3>
    <p>Did you notice that there is no X-axis!</p>
    <p>Although the graph might seem to be a normal X-Y plot, what looks
      like an X-axis is a visual metaphor showing how test results move
      from pre-test probability on the left to post-test probability on
      the right.</p>
    <p>This is why what looks like the X-axis has no scale.</p>

    The green horizontal line at y = 0.4 shows the pre-test probability
    of the condition, its prevalence, of 40%.<br>
    <br>
    The salmon pink line starting at the prevalence rate and ending at
    the positive predictive value (PPV) of 75% shows how a positive
    result increases the probability of the condition.<br>
    The&nbsp; = (1 - PPV), or 25% as initially set up in the app.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, the sea green&nbsp; line starting at the prevalence rate
    and ending at the negative predictive value (NPV) of 8% shows how a
    negative result decreases the probability of the condition.<br>

    The principle is simple: identify and quantify each of the pros and
    each of the cons for true and false postives and for false and true
    negatives, and weight them by their individual probabilities. This
    gives the net benefit (which will be negative if the expected harms
    and costs outweight the expected benefits. This is difficult to do,
    but health economists rise to the challenge. In technical terms, the
    recipe that the health economists folllow is:
    <div class="" style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <ul>
        <li>Decision threshold = (net harm)/(net harm + net benefit)</li>
        <li> Net harm = utility(no Rx | no disease) - utility(treatment
          | no disease)</li>
        <li> Net benefit = utility(Rx | disease) - utility(no treatment
          | disease)ease)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Because this type of health economic study is difficult and
      expensive, clinicians, patients, and the general public often have
      to use intuition and gut feeling to decide on decision thresholds.
    </p>
    <p>Informal setting of decision thresholds can be biased, either by
      over-emphasising the benefits in comparison with the harms, or
      vice versa.<br>
