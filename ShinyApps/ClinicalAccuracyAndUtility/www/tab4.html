    <title>Graph 2: clinical utility of a diagnostic test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">How to read graph 2: clinical
      utility of a diagnostic test</h2>
    <p>Graph 2 illustrates how decisions can be made rationally using
      information from a diagnostic test.</p>
    <p> A rational decision is one based on the clinical utility (i.e.
      the net benefits, harms, and costs) expected to follow from that
      decision.</p>
    <p>The clinical utility of a positive test result depends on (i) the
      net benefit for people who have a true positive result, and (ii)
      on the net benefit for people who have a false positive result.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the clinical utility of a negative test result depends
      on (i) the net benefit for people who have a true negative result,
      and (ii) on the net benefit for people who have a false negative
      result.</p>
    So, on balance for a group of people, their average clinical utility
    for a positive result depends on the true and false postive rates of
    the test, and for a negative result on true and false negative rates
    of the test.
    <p>Thus, the first step to assessing clinical utility is to
      understand the factors that determine decision-making. This is
      quite tricky, but Graph 2 can help. The aim is to gain an
      intuitive understanding of the predictive values of a test (the
      probabilities of the condition being present when a test is
      positive, or being absent when the test is negative), how these
      depend on the prevalance (prior probability) of the condition, and
      how treatment decisions depend, not simply on the result, but on
      the rates of true and false results.</p>
    <p>The explantions below require careful reading and exploration of
      the interactive graph, but this will be be repaid by the solid
      understanding that will result.<br>

    <p>You may have noticied that there are not one, but two Y-axes!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The left-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible pre-test
        probabilities: from 0 to 1 (scale shown)<br>
        .</li>
      <li>The right-hand Y-axis shows the range of possible post-test
        probabilities: also from 0 to 1 (scale not shown).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The X-axis</h3>
    <p>Did you notice that there is no X-axis!</p>
    <p>Although the graph might seem to be a normal X-Y plot, what looks
      like an X-axis is a visual metaphor showing how test results move
      from pre-test probability on the left to post-test probability on
      the right.</p>
    <p>This is why what looks like the X-axis has no scale.</p>

    The green horizontal line at y = 0.4 shows the pre-test probability

    The salmon pink line starting at the prevalence rate and ending at
    the positive predictive value (PPV) of 75% shows how a positive
    result increases the probability of the condition.<br>

    <br>
    Similarly, the sea green&nbsp; line starting at the prevalence rate
    and ending at the
    negative predictive value (NPV) of 8% shows how a negative result
    decreases the probability of the condition.<br>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Where do I find the data?</h2>
    <p>Data for your condition's prevalence and the test's accuracy
      (sensitivity and specificity) will be in the scientific
      literature, unless the test is under development, in which case
      unpublished data from the developer may be available.Use data from
      a (well conducted and well reported) systematic review and
      meta-analysis, if this is available. Otherwise, use data from a
      (well conducted and well reported) study. Data for the population
      size should be available from the the source of your accuracy
      data. </p>
    <p>Obtaining reliable data for the decision thresholds can be a
      challenge. But it is a challenge worth rising to, as the decision
      thresholds determine the clinical utility of the test.</p>
    <p>Health economists do the kind of studies that determine the
      decision threshold that provide the optimum cost for net benefit
      --- net benefit takes account of benefits and the harms. Costs,
      benefits, and harms are those that follow from doing the test and
      acting on its result.</p>
    <p>In technical terms, the recipe that the health economists folllow
      is:</p>

    <p>Because this type of health economic study is difficult and
      expensive, clinicians often have to use intuition and gut feeling
      to decide on decision thresholds. </p>
    <p>Informal setting of decision thresholds can be biased, either by
      over-emphasising the benefits in comparison with the harms, or
      vice versa. </p>
